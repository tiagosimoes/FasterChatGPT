Type less (or nothing at all) and get faster results.

## ChatGPT has several usability problems

These are some of them:
1. Users need to type too much;
2. Users need to wait too much;
3. Users need to read too much;
4. Users need to think too much;
5. Users need to choose between fast (GPT3.5) and smart (GPT4).

Some are particularly bad on mobile, and that's what *Faster ChatGPT* tries to address.

## How is *Faster ChatGPT* better?
- **It always gives suggestions!**
  - So you don't have to type so much.
- **It gives short answers!**
  - That you can expand through suggestions.
- **It's blazing fast, because it pre-fetches stuff!**
  - It tries to always be one step ahead of you.
- **It (smartly) decides between thinking fast and slow!**
  - If constantly adapts to you: when you're speed reading, you'll get fast results; if you're going a bit more slowly, you'll get smarter results.
- **It becomes smarter as you use it!**
  - The more you use it, the better the initial suggestions will be.

Quoting myself, so that I can feel smarter:
> If an "AI" system does not give contextual suggestions to its users, then that "AI" system does not have enough "I". And if it is slow doing it... then it has a slow "I". 

## You need to try it!
You need to experience it to "get it" üëâ https://tiagosimoes.github.io/FasterChatGPT/

NOTE: Sorry, but you'll need your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), otherwise, if this project would become viral, I would go bankrupt.

## How does it work?
It's all client-side, in just a single HTML file https://github.com/tiagosimoes/FasterChatGPT/blob/main/index.html, if you know a bit of JavaScript you'll grok it.

It amazes me that it's possible to create a complete and very useful app with these few lines of code.

#### P.S. To the OpenAI folks
I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è! You have the best API in the world. Feel free to take any of this, so you can also make the best app in the world.

#### P.P.S. Why is *Faster ChatGPT* italicized?
Because it's *fast*.
