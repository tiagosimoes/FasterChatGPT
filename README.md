Type less (or nothing at all) and get faster results.

## ChatGPT has several usability problems

Like these:
1. Users need to type too much;
2. Users need to wait too much;
3. Users need to read too much;
4. Users need to think too much;
5. Users need to choose between fast (GPT3.5) and smart (GPT4).

Some of them are particularly painful on mobile, and that's what *Faster ChatGPT* tries to address.

## How is *Faster ChatGPT* better?
- **It always gives suggestions!**
  - So you don't have to type or think so much.
- **It gives short answers!**
  - That you can expand through suggestions.
- **It's blazing fast!**
  - It tries to always be one step ahead of you, pre-fetching stuff.
- **It (smartly) decides between thinking fast and slow!**
  - If constantly adapts to you: when you're speed reading, you'll get fast results; if you're going a bit more slowly, you'll get smarter results. This will subtly keep you in a state of flow.
- **It becomes smarter as you use it!**
  - The more you use it, the better the initial suggestions will be.

Quoting myself, so that I can feel smarter:
> If an "AI" system does not give contextual suggestions to its users, then that "AI" system does not have enough "I". And if it is slow doing it... then it has a slow "I". 

## You need to try it!
You need to experience the speed to "get" it 👉 https://tiagosimoes.github.io/FasterChatGPT/

NOTE: Sorry, but you'll need your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys), otherwise, if this project would become viral, I would go bankrupt.

TIP: If you do need to type something, try typing a few words, like if you were Googling, instead of carefully crafting a complete sentence, like you would in ChatGPT. BTW, this still doesn't browse the web (in my experience it makes it too slow). 

## How does it work?
It's all client-side, in just a single HTML file https://github.com/tiagosimoes/FasterChatGPT/blob/main/index.html, if you know a bit of JavaScript you'll grok it.

It amazes me that it's possible to create a complete and very useful app with these few lines of code.

#### P.S. To the OpenAI folks
I love you ❤️! You have the best API in the world. Feel free to take any of this, so you can also make the best app in the world. If anyone can make this to scale to millions of users in a cost effective way, it's you. 

#### P.P.S. Why is *Faster ChatGPT* italicized?
Because it's *fast*.
